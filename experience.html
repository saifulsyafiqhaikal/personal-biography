<p>I have a small business of selling a scarf.I think its not a weirds things if a man sell a scarf and i alsoI just sell it in a cheapest price with a free postage and freegift.Beside that,The only reason i sell it in a cheapest price is to make sure that everyone can afford to buy it.Next,I always remember my father advise which is
"if we are always help others,InshaAllah Allah will help us"
My Father was passed away 1 years ago and if i starring at his photo,i will remember everything all about his words to me
THIS IS ONE OF THE EXAMPLE OF MY SCARF</p>
